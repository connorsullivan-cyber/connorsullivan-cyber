<h2>About me:</h2>

I am an eight year film industry professional working on a career change into cybersecurity! I completed my Google Cybersecurity Professional certificate a couple months ago and I just completed my CompTIA Security+ certification! I've spent hundreds of hours on TryHackMe developing technical skills, making it into the top 1% of rooms completed. Over the years I have developed an eye for detail, a passion to continuously learn more, and the ability to creatively solve problems and adapt quickly in changing environments.
